# TOEIC 600 Words Scraped Dataset

Learning English can be done in many ways, and not everyone wants to rely solely on language learning apps. Some prefer to access vocabulary datasets and integrate them into their own tools, such as [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

To support those looking for a structured TOEIC 600 words dataset and to enhance my data scraping skills, I created this project.
